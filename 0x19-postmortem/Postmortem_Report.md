# Postmortem Report: Incident ID #12345

**Date and Time:** May 12, 2024, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM (UTC)

## Issue Summary:
The incident involved a service outage for our e-commerce platform, which occurred due to a misconfiguration in the deployment pipeline. The outage lasted for approximately 90 minutes, resulting in a loss of revenue and customer trust.

## Timeline of Events:

- **10:00 AM:** Automated deployment of a new feature to the production environment initiated.
- **10:05 AM:** DevOps team noticed unusually high CPU usage on production servers.
- **10:10 AM:** Investigation began into the root cause of CPU spikes.
- **10:20 AM:** Identified misconfiguration in the deployment script, causing the application to spawn excessive threads.
- **10:30 AM:** Rolled back the deployment to the previous stable version to mitigate the issue.
- **11:00 AM:** CPU usage stabilized, but performance remained degraded due to increased load on the servers.
- **11:30 AM:** Service fully restored after applying optimization patches and load balancing adjustments.

## Root Cause Analysis:
The primary cause of the incident was identified as a misconfiguration in the deployment script. During the deployment of a new feature, an incorrect setting was applied, leading to the application creating excessive threads and consuming excessive CPU resources. This misconfiguration went unnoticed during the pre-deployment testing phase.

## Contributing Factors:
Several factors contributed to the severity and duration of the incident:
- Lack of thorough testing: The misconfiguration was not detected during the pre-deployment testing phase, highlighting gaps in our testing procedures.
- Inadequate monitoring: While CPU spikes were detected promptly, there was insufficient monitoring in place to identify the root cause immediately.
- Complexity of deployment process: The deployment process involved multiple manual steps, increasing the likelihood of human error.

## Mitigation Steps Taken:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following steps have been taken:
- Automated testing: Enhanced automated testing procedures to catch misconfigurations and performance issues before deployment.
- Improved monitoring: Implemented additional monitoring metrics to detect abnormal behavior and identify issues more quickly.
- Deployment pipeline review: Conducted a thorough review of the deployment pipeline to identify and address any other potential misconfigurations.
- Documentation update: Updated documentation to provide clearer guidance on deployment procedures and best practices.

## Action Items:
- Conduct a postmortem review meeting to discuss lessons learned and identify further improvements.
- Develop and implement automated configuration checks to prevent similar misconfigurations.
- Review and optimize the deployment process to minimize manual intervention and reduce the risk of human error.

## Conclusion:
The service outage was a result of a misconfiguration in the deployment process, compounded by inadequate testing and monitoring practices. By implementing the mitigation steps outlined above and continuously improving our processes, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the reliability and stability of our e-commerce platform.
